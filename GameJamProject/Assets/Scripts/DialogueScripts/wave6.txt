The Witch%Think that's all of them. Satisfied?
Ash%Better than before.
The Witch%What's the full story anyway?
Ash%...town got attacked while I was young. Family got turned. Ran away. Regretted it.
The Witch%I see. Feeling better now?
Ash%About as good as you can feel from mercy killing your tree family, yes.
The Witch%Well, you also freed me from my job, so that's a bonus. Care to take me to town? Forest got boring.
Ash%Ugh, sure? Why not. I could use the company.
